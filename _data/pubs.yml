- abs: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence
    and robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic
    manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent
    work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to
    making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community
    currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs
    can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel
    benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation
    reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well
    they understand object-object interactions and deformable object
    manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model
    families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes.
    Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies
    across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and
    trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there
    remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding.

- abs: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high
    dimensionality and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand
    imitation learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception
    by focusing on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse
    demonstrations remains costly, motivating the need for scalable data
    augmentation. While prior work has explored visual augmentation in
    single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation
    requires generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and
    producing corresponding action labels that are both valid and feasible. In
    this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated Dual-arm Data Augmentation
    (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation tailored to eye-in-hand
    bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion model to synthesize
    novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both arms while
    simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs constrained
    optimization to ensure that augmented states involving gripper-to-object
    contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual coordination. We
    evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across
    2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that it
    outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable data
    augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation.

- abs: Legged robots have the potential to leverage obstacles to climb steep
    sand slopes. However, efficiently repositioning these obstacles to desired
    locations is challenging. Here we present DiffusiveGRAIN, a learning-based
    method that enables a multi-legged robot to strategically induce localized
    sand avalanches during locomotion and indirectly manipulate obstacles. We
    conducted 375 trials, systematically varying obstacle spacing, robot
    orientation, and leg actions in 75 of them. Results show that the movement
    of closely-spaced obstacles exhibits significant interference, requiring
    joint modeling. In addition, different multi-leg excavation actions could
    cause distinct robot state changes, necessitating integrated planning of
    manipulation and locomotion.  To address these challenges, DiffusiveGRAIN
    includes a diffusion-based environment predictor to capture multi-obstacle
    movements under granular flow interferences and a robot state predictor to
    estimate changes in robot state from multi-leg action patterns. Deployment
    experiments (90 trials) demonstrate that by integrating the environment and
    robot state predictors, the robot can autonomously plan its movements based
    on loco-manipulation goals, successfully shifting closely located rocks to
    desired locations in over 65% of trials. Our study showcases the potential
    for a locomoting robot to strategically manipulate obstacles to achieve
    improved mobility on challenging terrains.

- abs: We introduce RoLA, a framework that transforms any in-the-wild image into
    an interactive, physics-enabled robotic environment. Unlike previous
    methods, RoLA operates directly on a single image without requiring
    additional hardware or digital assets. Our framework democratizes robotic
    data generation by producing massive visuomotor robotic demonstrations
    within minutes from a wide range of image sources, including camera
    captures, robotic datasets, and Internet images. At its core, our approach
    combines a novel method for single-view physical scene recovery with an
    efficient visual blending strategy for photorealistic data collection. We
    demonstrate RoLA's versatility across applications like scalable robotic
    data generation and augmentation, robot learning from Internet images, and
    single-image real-to-sim-to-real systems for manipulators and humanoids.

- abs: Sequentially grasping multiple objects with multi-fingered hands is
    common in daily life, where humans can fully leverage the dexterity of their
    hands to enclose multiple objects. However, the diversity of object
    geometries and the complex contact interactions required for high-DOF hands
    to grasp one object while enclosing another make sequential multi-object
    grasping challenging for robots. In this paper, we propose SeqMultiGrasp, a
    system for sequentially grasping objects with a four-fingered Allegro Hand.
    We focus on sequentially grasping two objects, ensuring that the hand fully
    encloses one object before lifting it and then grasps the second object
    without dropping the first. Our system first synthesizes single-object grasp
    candidates, where each grasp is constrained to use only a subset of the
    hand's links. These grasps are then validated in a physics simulator to
    ensure stability and feasibility. Next, we merge the validated single-object
    grasp poses to construct multi-object grasp configurations. For real-world
    deployment, we train a diffusion model conditioned on point clouds to
    propose grasp poses, followed by a heuristic-based execution strategy. We
    test our system using 8x8 object combinations in simulation and 6x3 object
    combinations in real. Our diffusion-based grasp model obtains an average
    success rate of 65.8% over 1600 simulation trials and 56.7% over 90
    real-world trials, suggesting that it is a promising approach for sequential
    multi-object grasping with multi-fingered hands.

- abs: Advancing dexterous manipulation with multi-fingered robotic hands
    requires rich sensory capabilities, but existing designs lack onboard
    thermal and torque sensing. In this work, we propose the MOTIF hand, a novel
    multimodal and versatile robotic hand that extends the LEAP hand by
    integrating (i) dense tactile information across the fingers and palm, (ii)
    a depth sensor, (iii) a thermal camera, (iv), IMU sensors, and (v) a visual
    sensor.  The MOTIF hand is designed to be relatively low-cost (under 4000
    USD) and easily reproducible.  We also propose experiments to validate our
    hand design by using it to reconstruct 3D scenes and infer thermal
    affordances of objects with varying temperatures.  Our experiments will
    demonstrate that the MOTIF hand is a promising approach for the future of
    dexterous robotic hands with multiple sensors.

- abs: Real-time human perception is crucial for successful human-robot
    interaction (HRI). Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer great potential
    for generalizable perceptual capabilities but often suffer from increased
    latency, negatively impacting user experience and thus limiting their
    real-world applicability. To systematically study VLMs' capabilities in human
    perception for HRI and their performance-latency tradeoff, we introduce
    HRIBench, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate
    VLMs on a diverse set of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI.  HRIBench
    covers five key domains. (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal
    instruction understanding, (3) human-robot-object relationship
    understanding, (4) social navigation, and (5) person identification. In this
    work, we conduct HRI experiments to collect real-world HRI data while also
    leveraging existing datasets to design new VQA questions for VLM evaluation.
    Our preliminary results demonstrate that, despite their generalizability,
    VLMs still struggle with fundamental perceptual skills important for HRI.
    For the final paper submission, we plan to expand HRIBench to 1,000 VQA
    questions and conduct a full evaluation of state-of-the-art closed-source
    and open-source VLMs.

- abs: Understanding the physical world is a fundamental challenge in embodied
    AI, critical for enabling agents to perform complex tasks and operate
    safely in real-world environments. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
    shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents,
    their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited.
    To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark
    designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a
    diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 100,000 entries of interleaved
    video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains, physical object
    properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding,
    and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8
    distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 39
    representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense
    reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world---likely due
    to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of
    embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent,
    a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with
    the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs'
    physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4%
    improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing
    VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can significantly help the
    deployment of embodied agents, pushing the boundaries of machine
    intelligence in comprehending and interacting with the physical world. We
    believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute
    to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.

- abs: Cross-modal feature extraction and integration have led to steady
    performance improvements in few-shot learning tasks due to generating
    richer features. However, existing multi-modal object detection (MM-OD)
    methods degrade when facing significant domain-shift and are sample
    insufficient. We hypothesize that rich text information could more
    effectively help the model to build a knowledge relationship between the
    vision instance and its language description and can help mitigate domain
    shift. Specifically, we study the Cross-Domain few-shot generalization of
    MM-OD (CDMM-FSOD) and propose a meta-learning based multi-modal few-shot
    object detection method that utilizes rich text semantic information as an
    auxiliary modality to achieve domain adaptation in the context of FSOD. Our
    proposed network contains (i) a multi-modal feature aggregation module that
    aligns the vision and language support feature embeddings and (ii) a rich
    text semantic rectify module that utilizes bidirectional text feature
    generation to reinforce multi-modal feature alignment and thus to enhance
    the model's language understanding capability. We evaluate our model on
    common standard cross-domain object detection datasets and demonstrate that
    our approach considerably outperforms existing FSOD methods.

- abs: Robotic object singulation, where a robot must isolate, grasp, and
    retrieve a target object in a cluttered environment, is a fundamental
    challenge in robotic manipulation. This task is difficult due to occlusions
    and how other objects act as obstacles for manipulation. A robot must also
    reason about the effect of object-object interactions as it tries to
    singulate the target. Prior work has explored object singulation in
    scenarios where there is enough free space to perform relatively long pushes
    to separate objects, in contrast to when space is tight and objects have
    little separation from each other. In this paper, we propose the Singulating
    Objects in Packed Environments (SOPE) framework. We propose a novel method
    that involves a displacement-based state representation and a multi-phase
    reinforcement learning procedure that enables singulation using the 16-DOF
    Allegro Hand. We demonstrate extensive experiments in Isaac Gym simulation,
    showing the ability of our system to singulate a target object in clutter.
    We directly transfer the policy trained in simulation to the real world.
    Over 250 physical robot manipulation trials, our method obtains success
    rates of 79.2%, outperforming alternative learning and non-learning methods.

- abs: Fabric manipulation has applications in folding blankets, handling
    patient clothing, and protecting items with covers. It is challenging for
    robots to perform fabric manipulation since fabrics have
    infinite-dimensional configuration spaces, complex dynamics, and may be in
    folded or crumpled configurations with severe self-occlusions. Prior work on
    robotic fabric manipulation relies either on heavily engineered setups or
    learning-based approaches that create and train on robot-fabric interaction
    data. In this paper, we propose GPT-Fabric for the canonical tasks of fabric
    smoothing and folding, where GPT directly outputs an action informing a
    robot where to grasp and pull a fabric. We perform extensive experiments in
    simulation to test GPT-Fabric against prior state of the art methods for
    smoothing and folding. We obtain comparable or better performance to most
    methods even without explicitly training on a fabric-specific dataset (i.e.,
    zero-shot manipulation).  Furthermore, we apply GPT-Fabric in physical
    experiments over 10 smoothing and 12 folding rollouts. Our results suggest
    that GPT-Fabric is a promising approach for high-precision fabric
    manipulation tasks.

- abs: Legged robot locomotion on sand slopes is challenging due to the complex
    dynamics of granular media and how the lack of solid surfaces can hinder
    locomotion. A promising strategy, inspired by ghost crabs and other
    organisms in nature, is to strategically interact with rocks, debris, and
    other obstacles to facilitate movement. To provide legged robots with this
    ability, we present a novel approach that leverages avalanche dynamics to
    indirectly manipulate objects on a granular slope. We use a Vision
    Transformer (ViT) to process image representations of granular dynamics and
    robot excavation actions. The ViT predicts object movement, which we use to
    determine which leg excavation action to execute. We collect training data
    from 100 real physical trials and, at test time, deploy our trained model
    in novel settings. Experimental results suggest that our model can
    accurately predict object movements and achieve a success rate ≥80% in a
    variety of manipulation tasks with up to four obstacles, and can also
    generalize to objects with different physics properties. To our knowledge,
    this is the first paper to leverage granular media avalanche dynamics to
    indirectly manipulate objects on granular slopes.

- abs: Bimanual manipulation is critical to many robotics applications. In
    contrast to single-arm manipulation, bimanual manipulation tasks are
    challenging due to higher-dimensional action spaces. Prior works leverage
    large amounts of data and primitive actions to address this problem, but
    may suffer from sample inefficiency and limited generalization across
    various tasks. To this end, we propose VoxAct-B, a language-conditioned,
    voxel-based method that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
    prioritize key regions within the scene and reconstruct a voxel grid. We
    provide this voxel grid to our bimanual manipulation policy to learn acting
    and stabilizing actions.  This approach enables more efficient policy
    learning from voxels and is generalizable to different tasks. In
    simulation, we show that VoxAct-B outperforms strong baselines on

- abs: Many fabric handling and 2D deformable material tasks in homes and
    industry require singulating layers of material such as opening a bag or
    arranging garments for sewing. In contrast to methods requiring specialized
    sensing or end effectors, we use only visual observations with ordinary parallel
    jaw grippers. We propose SLIP, Singulating Layers using Interactive Perception,
    and apply SLIP to the task of autonomous bagging. We develop SLIP-Bagging, a
    bagging algorithm that manipulates a plastic or fabric bag from an unstructured
    state, and uses SLIP to grasp the top layer of the bag to open it for object
    insertion. In physical experiments, a YuMi robot achieves a success rate of 67%
    to 81% across bags of a variety of materials, shapes, and sizes, significantly
    improving in success rate and generality over prior work. Experiments also
    suggest that SLIP can be applied to tasks such as singulating layers of folded
    cloth and garments.

- abs: Thin plastic bags are ubiquitous in retail stores, healthcare, food
    handling, recycling, homes, and school lunchrooms. They are challenging
    both for perception (due to specularities and occlusions) and for
    manipulation (due to the dynamics of their 3D deformable structure). We
    formulate the task of manipulating common plastic shopping bags with two
    handles from an unstructured initial state to a state where solid objects can
    be inserted into the bag for transport. We propose a self-supervised learning
    framework where a dual-arm robot learns to recognize the handles and rim of
    plastic bags using UV-fluorescent markings; at execution time, the robot does
    not use UV markings or UV light. We propose Autonomous Bagging (AutoBag), where
    the robot uses the learned perception model to open plastic bags through
    iterative manipulation.  We present novel metrics to evaluate the quality of a
    bag state and new motion primitives for reorienting and opening bags from
    visual observations. In physical experiments, a YuMi robot using AutoBag is
    able to open bags and achieve a success rate of 16/30 for inserting at least
    one item across a variety of initial bag configurations

- abs: "Point clouds are a widely available and canonical data modality which
    conveys the 3D geometry of a scene. Despite significant progress in
    classification and segmentation from point clouds, policy learning from
    such a modality remains challenging, and most prior works in imitation
    learning focus on learning policies from images or state information. In
    this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning policies from point
    clouds for robotic manipulation with tools. We use a novel neural network,
    ToolFlowNet, which predicts dense per-point flow on the tool that the robot
    controls, and then uses the flow to derive the transformation that the robot
    should execute. We apply this framework to imita- tion learning of
    challenging deformable object manipulation tasks with continuous movement of
    tools, including scooping and pouring, and demonstrate significantly
    improved performance over baselines which do not use flow. We perform 50
    physical scooping experiments with ToolFlowNet and attain 82% scooping

- abs: Robotic manipulation of cloth has applications ranging from fabrics manufacturing
    to handling blankets and laundry. Cloth manipulation is challenging for robots
    largely due to their high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and severe self-occlusions
    when in folded or crumpled configurations. Prior work on robotic manipulation
    of cloth relies primarily on vision sensors alone, which may pose challenges for
    fine-grained manipulation tasks such as grasping a desired number of cloth layers
    from a stack of cloth. In this paper, we propose to use tactile sensing for cloth
    manipulation; we attach a tactile sensor (ReSkin) to one of the two fingertips
    of a Franka robot and train a classifier to determine whether the robot is grasping
    a specific number of cloth layers. During test-time experiments, the robot uses
    this classifier as part of its policy to grasp one or two cloth layers using tactile
    feedback to determine suitable grasping points. Experimental results over 180
    physical trials suggest that the proposed method outperforms baselines that do
    not use tactile feedback and has a better generalization to unseen fabrics compared
    to methods that use image classifiers.

- abs: "Recent work has shown that 2-arm 'fling' motions can be effective for
    garment smoothing. We consider single-arm fling motions. Unlike 2-arm fling
    motions, which require little robot trajectory parameter tuning, single-arm
    fling motions are very sensitive to trajectory parameters. We consider a
    single 6-DOF robot arm that learns fling trajectories to achieve high
    garment coverage.  Given a garment grasp point, the robot explores different
    parameterized fling trajectories in physical experiments. To improve
    learning efficiency, we propose a coarse-to-fine learning method that first
    uses a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to efficiently find a candidate
    fling action, which it then refines via a continuous optimization method.
    Further, we propose novel training and execution-time stopping criteria
    based on fling outcome uncertainty; the training-time stopping criterion
    increases data efficiency while the execution-time stopping criteria
    leverage repeated fling actions to increase performance. Compared to
    baselines, the proposed method significantly accelerates learning. Moreover,
    with prior experience on similar garments collected through
    self-supervision, the MAB learning time for a new garment is reduced by up
    to 87%. We evaluate on 36 real garments: towels, T-shirts, long-sleeve
    shirts, dresses, sweat pants, and jeans. Results suggest that using prior
    experience, a robot requires under 30 minutes to learn a fling action for a
    novel garment that achieves 60-94% coverage."

    different but related tasks. We build upon the Visual Foresight framework to
    learn fabric dynamics that can be efficiently reused to accomplish different
    sequential fabric manipulation tasks with a single goal-conditioned policy.
    We extend our earlier work on VisuoSpatial Foresight (VSF), which learns
    visual dynamics on domain randomized RGB images and depth maps
    simultaneously and completely in simulation. In this earlier work, we
    evaluated VSF on multi-step fabric smoothing and folding tasks against 5
    baseline methods in simulation and on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
    surgical robot without any demonstrations at train or test time. A key
    finding was that depth sensing significantly improves performance: RGBD data
    yields an 80% improvement in fabric folding success rate in simulation over
    pure RGB data. In this work, we vary 4 components of VSF, including data
    generation, visual dynamics model, cost function, and optimization
    procedure. Results suggest that training visual dynamics models using
    longer, corner-based actions can improve the efficiency of fabric folding by
    76% and enable a physical sequential fabric folding task that VSF could not

    framework finds a 3D apex point for the robot arm, which, together with a
    task-specific trajectory function, defines an arcing motion that dynamically
    manipulates the cable to perform tasks with varying obstacle and target

    point by repeatedly solving quadratic programs to find the shortest and
    fastest feasible motion. We experiment with 5 physical cables with different

    algorithms which can efficiently learn many different tasks. In this paper,
    we learn visual correspondences for deformable fabrics across different
    configurations in simulation and show that this representation can be used
    to design policies for a variety of tasks. Given a single demonstration of a

    across 10 fabric manipulation tasks on two different robotic systems, the da

- abs: "Automation of surgical tasks using cable-driven robots is challenging
    due to backlash, hysteresis, and cable tension, and these issues are
    exacerbated as surgical instruments must often be changed during an
    operation. In this work, we propose a framework for automation of
    high-precision surgical tasks by learning sample efficient, accurate,
    closed-loop policies that operate directly on visual feedback instead of
    robot encoder estimates. This framework, which we call intermittent visual
    servoing (IVS), intermittently switches to a learned visual servo policy for
    high-precision segments of repetitive surgical tasks while relying on a
    coarse open-loop policy for the segments where precision is not necessary.
    To compensate for cable-related effects, we apply imitation learning to
    rapidly train a policy that maps images of the workspace and instrument from
    a top-down RGB camera to small corrective motions. We train the policy using
    only 180 human demonstrations that are roughly 2 seconds each.  Results on a
    da Vinci Research Kit suggest that combining the coarse policy with half a
    second of corrections from the learned policy during each high-precision
    segment improves the success rate on the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic
    Surgery peg transfer task from 72.9% to 99.2%, 31.3% to 99.2%, and 47.2% to
    100.0% for 3 instruments with differing cable-related effects. In the
    contexts we studied, IVS attains the highest published success rates for
    automated surgical peg transfer and is significantly more reliable than
    previous techniques when instruments are changed."

    sample, estimate pick points and pull vectors to spread the fabric to
    maximize coverage. To generate data, we develop a fabric simulator and an

    aggregation (DAgger) on three tiers of difficulty in the initial randomized
    configuration. We present results comparing five baseline policies to

    efficiently calibrate such robots by placing a 3D printed fiducial
    coordinate frames on the arm and end-effector that is tracked using RGBD
    sensing. To measure the coupling and history-dependent effects between
    joints, we analyze data from sampled trajectories and consider 13 approaches

    We perform physical experiments with two mobile manipulator robots, the
    Toyota HSR and the Fetch, and three blankets of different colors and
    textures. We compare coverage results from (1) human supervision, (2) a
    baseline of picking at the uppermost blanket point, and (3) learned pick
    points. On a quarter-scale twin bed, a model trained with combined data from
    the two robots achieves 92% blanket coverage compared with 83% for the

    blankets and achieves 93% coverage. Average coverage results of 92% for 193

- abs: "Deep reinforcement learning has recently made significant progress in
    solving computer games and robotic control tasks. A known problem, though,
    is that policies overfit to the training environment and may not avoid rare,
    catastrophic events such as automotive accidents. A classical technique for
    improving the robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms is to train on
    a set of randomized environments, but this approach only guards against
    common situations. Recently, robust adversarial reinforcement learning
    (RARL) was developed, which allows efficient applications of random and
    systematic perturbations by a trained adversary. A limitation of RARL is
    that only the expected control objective is optimized; there is no explicit
    modeling or optimization of risk. Thus the agents do not consider the
    probability of catastrophic events (i.e., those inducing abnormally large
    negative reward), except through their effect on the expected objective. In
    this paper we introduce risk-averse robust adversarial reinforcement
    learning (RARARL), using a risk-averse protagonist and a risk-seeking
    adversary. We test our approach on a self-driving vehicle controller. We use
    an ensemble of policy networks to model risk as the variance of value
    functions. We show through experiments that a risk-averse agent is better
    equipped to handle a risk-seeking adversary, and experiences substantially
    fewer crashes compared to agents trained without an adversary."

    diseased tissue fragments) with Robotic Surgical Assistants (RSAs) such as
    the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) is challenging due to inherent
    non-linearities in cable-driven systems. We propose and evaluate a novel
    two-phase coarse-to-fine calibration method. In Phase I (coarse), we place a
    red calibration marker on the end effector and let it randomly move through
    a set of open-loop trajectories to obtain a large sample set of camera
    pixels and internal robot end-effector configurations. This coarse data is
    then used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn the coarse
    transformation bias. In Phase II (fine), the bias from Phase I is applied to
    move the end-effector toward a small set of specific target points on a
    printed sheet. For each target, a human operator manually adjusts the
    end-effector position by direct contact (not through teleoperation) and the
    residual compensation bias is recorded. This fine data is then used to train
    a Random Forest (RF) to learn the fine transformation bias. Subsequent
    experiments suggest that without calibration, position errors average
    4.55mm. Phase I can reduce average error to 2.14mm and the combination of
    Phase I and Phase II can reduces average error to 1.08mm. We apply these
    results to debridement of raisins and pumpkin seeds as fragment phantoms.
    Using an endoscopic stereo camera with standard edge detection, experiments
    with 120 trials achieved average success rates of 94.5%, exceeding prior
    results with much larger fragments (89.4%) and achieving a speedup of 2.1x,
